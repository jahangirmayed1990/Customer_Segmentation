## Customer Segmentation for Mall Customers Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm
K-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into clusters based on their similarity. In the context of mall customer segmentation, this algorithm can be used to group customers based on their spending habits, demographics, and other relevant factors.
### Steps Involved for this Clustering:
1.	**Data Collection:** Gather relevant customer data, such as age, gender, annual income, spending score, and other relevant attributes.
2.	**Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Normalize or standardize the data to ensure all features have equal importance. Missingno library used for visualizing and handling missing data in datasets.    
3.	**Choosing the Number of Clusters (K):** Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method and silhouette analysis.
4.	**K-Means Clustering:** Apply the K-Means algorithm to the preprocessed data, specifying the chosen number of clusters. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.   
5.	**Cluster Analysis:** Analyze the resulting clusters to identify patterns and characteristics. Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or other appropriate techniques.
6.	**Interpretation and Actionable Insights:** Interpret the characteristics of each cluster and develop targeted marketing strategies for each segment.
